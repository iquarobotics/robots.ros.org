The [Girona 500](http://iquarobotics.com/girona-500-auv) AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) is a reconfigurable autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from [IQUA Robotics](http://iquarobotics.com). It is designed for a maximum operating depth of up to 500 m. The vehicle is composed of three torpedo-shaped hulls which offers a good hydrodynamic performance and a large space for housing the equipments while maintaining a compact size. The most remarkable characteristic of the Girona 500 is its capacity to reconfigure for different tasks.

* **High stability** and full hovering capability
* **Lightweight** and easy equipment integration
* Customizable **payload area**
* **Open software** architecture based on ROS: **COLA 2**
* **GUI** for mission definition and monitoring: **IQUAView**

The Girona 500 AUV uses the **COLA2** Software architecture and can be operated using **IQUAview**.

### COLA2
[COLA2](http://iquarobotics.com/cola2) (Component Oriented Layered-based Architecture for Autonomy) is the ROS-based software architecture running in IQUA robotics AUVs. 
You can find a description of the different COLA2 packages and directions to test the Girona 500 AUV in simulation in the [COLA2 Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/iquarobotics/cola2_core/wiki/Home).

### IQUAview

[IQUAview](http://iquarobotics.com/iquaview-graphical-user-interface) is the graphical user interface (GUI) that allows to operate IQUA robotics AUVs in a simple and user-friendly manner. IQUAview provides a front-end to the COLA2 architecture in order to be able to communicate with the robot, configure a basic set of parameters, plan missions and monitor them using an intuitive graphical interface based in a QGIS backend. 

[Here](https://bitbucket.org/iquarobotics/iquaview) you can find more information and download IQUAview to test it with the Girona 500 AUV simulation.
