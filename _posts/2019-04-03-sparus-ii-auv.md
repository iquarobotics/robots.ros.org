The [SPARUS II](http://iquarobotics.com/sparus-ii-auv) AUV (Autonomus Underwater Vehicle) is a lightweight hovering vehicle from [IQUA Robotics](http://iquarobotics.com). It has a mission-specific payload area and efficient hydrodynamics for long autonomy in shallow water (200 meters). It combines torpedo-shape performance with hovering capability. It is easy to deploy and to operate. The payload area can be customized by the end user and it uses a ROS-based software architecture for mission programming. Its flexibility, easy operation  and openness makes the SPARUS II AUV a multipurpose platform that can adapt to industrial, scientific and academic applications.
* **Torpedo-shaped** for efficient hydrodynamics and better autonomy
* **Hovering capable**, high maneuverability
* **Lightweight**
* **Easy operation**. It can be deployed by 2 people from any boat
* **Open hardware** for easy payload integration
* **ROS-based** software architecture
* **Low cost**

The Sparus II AUV uses the **COLA2** Software architecture and can be operated using **IQUAview**.

### COLA2
[COLA2](http://iquarobotics.com/cola2) (Component Oriented Layered-based Architecture for Autonomy) is the ROS-based software architecture running in IQUA robotics AUVs. 
You can find a description of the different COLA2 packages and directions to test the Sparus II AUV in simulation in the [COLA2 Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/iquarobotics/cola2_core/wiki/Home).

### IQUAview

[IQUAview](http://iquarobotics.com/iquaview-graphical-user-interface) is the graphical user interface (GUI) that allows to operate IQUA robotics AUVs in a simple and user-friendly manner. IQUAview provides a front-end to the COLA2 architecture in order to be able to communicate with the robot, configure a basic set of parameters, plan missions and monitor them using an intuitive graphical interface based in a QGIS backend. 

[Here](https://bitbucket.org/iquarobotics/iquaview) you can find more information and download IQUAview to test it with the Sparus II AUV simulation.
